# EctoIdentifier :dart:

_When UUID is not enough!_

Provides some custom [`Ecto`][ecto] [type][ecto-type]s to work with identifier
fields that are generated using:

1. [`nanoid`][nanoid]s (`Ecto.Nanoid`)
2. [`hashids`][hashids] (`Ecto.Hashids`)

## Ecto.Nanoid

[Nanoid are as safe and sound as UUIDs, but more
compact](https://github.com/ai/nanoid). Check them out [in real
life!](https://alex7kom.github.io/nano-nanoid-cc/) :rainbow:

The type defines an `autogenerate/0` that can generate a nanoid for you at
"insert-time". You don't have to worry about adding the field to your changeset
`cast`/`validate_required` (just like those auto-generated timestamps)!

``` elixir
defmodule Post do
  use Ecto.Schema
  alias Ecto.Nanoid

  schema "posts" do
    field(:number, Ecto.Nanoid, autogenerate: true)
    field(:data, :string)
  end
end
```
And voila!

``` elixir
iex> changeset = Post.changeset(%Post{}, %{data: "the answer to everything"})
iex> changeset.changes.number
nil                                         # coz it's autogenerated!
iex> a_tough_one = Repo.insert!(changeset)
iex> %Post{
  id: 42,
  number: "swv~u7bIyewzBFOKuFbbD",          # there we have it!
}
```
> If you pass in a `:number` in the `params`, a nanoid will not be autogenerated
> for you. For more juicy detals see `Ecto.Schema`.

#### Why a "type"

Well, to make Ecto compute the ID only at "insert-time", you gotta define an
`autogenerate/0` for that field's `type`.  Which means, this nanoid field needs
to be of _a custom `Ecto.Type`_, ala `Ecto.Nanoid`.

#### Can I use this as my primary key?

Well of course! _An example is coming soon!_

## Ecto.Hashids

_Coming shortly folks!_

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ecto_identifier` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ecto_identifier, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
